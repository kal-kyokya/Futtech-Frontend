To access the content rendered by your app on `localhost:5174` from your computer while coding on the Linode server using Git Bash, follow these steps:

### **1. SSH Port Forwarding (Tunneling)**
You can use SSH port forwarding to securely access the remote app as if it were running locally.

Run the following command on your local machine (replace `your-linode-ip` with your serverâ€™s IP):

```sh
ssh -L 5174:localhost:5174 your-user@your-linode-ip
```

- This forwards traffic from `localhost:5174` on your local computer to `localhost:5174` on the Linode server.
- Now, you should be able to access the app by opening **http://localhost:5174** in your browser.

### **2. Modify the Vite Configuration (If Necessary)**
If you're using Vite (which typically serves on port 5174), ensure it binds to all network interfaces by updating the `vite.config.js` file:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    port: 5174,
  }
});
```

Then, restart the Vite development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This ensures that the app is accessible from external devices.

### **3. Adjust Firewall and Security Rules**
If you prefer accessing the server directly using its IP address:

- Allow incoming traffic on port `5174` using `ufw` (Ubuntu):

  ```sh
  sudo ufw allow 5174/tcp
  sudo ufw reload
  ```

- Check if Linode has a Cloud Firewall restricting traffic and update it accordingly.

Now, try accessing **http://your-linode-ip:5174** from your local browser.
